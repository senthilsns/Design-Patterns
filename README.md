iOS Design Patterns


1. Singleton 

   The singleton pattern guarantees that only one instance of a class is instantiated.
   
2. Facade
   
   Facade defines an simpler interface to an complex subsystem
   
3. Proxy

    Proxy is an object to help us to access another object. It simply delegates real job to that
    object or change its behavior.
   
4. Memento 

    The role of the memento pattern is to capture an object's internal state and save it externally 
    so that it can be restored later without breaking the encapsulation of this object.
    
5. Factory

    Factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact 
    class of the object that will be created.
    
6. Abstract Factory

    The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that
    have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.It handles a little more complex use case.
    
7. Adapter

     Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. 
     In other words, it transforms the interface of an object to adapt it to a different object.
    
8. Delegation

     The delegation design pattern is a relatively easy way to communicate between two objects through a common 
     interface, protocol in Swift.
     
9. Observer

     Observer pattern(Notification,KVO), one object notifies other objects of any state changes. 
    
10. KVC

     KVC is a form of coding that allows you to access an object’s properties indirectly, 
     using strings to access them instead of the property’s accessors or instead of accessing
     the variables directly.
