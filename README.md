iOS Design Patterns


1. Singleton 

   The singleton pattern guarantees that only one instance of a class is instantiated.
   
2. Facade
   
   Facade defines an simpler interface to an complex subsystem
   
3. Proxy

    Proxy is an object to help us to access another object. It simply delegates real job to that
    object or change its behavior.
   
4. Memento 

    The role of the memento pattern is to capture an object's internal state and save it externally 
    so that it can be restored later without breaking the encapsulation of this object.
    
5. Factory

    Factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact 
    class of the object that will be created.
